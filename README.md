# Section One: Summary

# Problem Definition - In order to mitigate the agrarian crisis in the current status quo, there is a need for better recommendation systems to alleviate the crisis by helping the farmers to make an informed decision before starting the cultivation of crops. The “Crop Advisor for Crop Cultivation using Machine Learning” will be an application that will suggest suitable crops to be cultivated based on various factors such as rainfall, temperature, soil type etc. 

# Scope – To recommend optimum crops to be cultivated by farmers based on various parameters and help them make an informed decision before cultivation   
The application would entail the following modules with the following functionalities:

1.) Web interface: The Web Interface will interact with the farmers to collect information and statistics

It will interact with the Cloud Storage to store in Database.

Will transfer the data to the Machine Learning agent for subsequent processing of data.

2.) Machine Learning Agent:

Training of data

Testing on a section of test data

Prediction based on the trained dataset

3.) Cloud Database: Storing of information and subsequent transfer of information to Machine Learning agent

Updation of Data

implementing more accurate models by carrying out data pre processing and data cleaning.


# Section Four: Outputs and Deliverables

Output and Deliverables -

predicting the relevant crop to the farmer for their cultivation

usage of algorithm having the highest accuracy  


# Section Five: Outcomes and Lessons Learned
The following outcomes have been observed -

a)GUI implementation 

b) training and testing of model 

c) running different machine learning algos 

d) integrating the backend with the front end

e) provided speech input services to the farmers for ease of use


# Section Six: Usage of Tools
The various tools used are: 

Flask 

Bootstrap 

Google colab 

# Section Seven: Evaluation
The various evaluation’s were regarding the following points :
a) model accuracy score

b) accuracy of the working of the speech to text conversion module 

c) rss feed update

# Section Eight: Dissemination
Paper presentation, Project competition participation

# Section Nine: Risks, Issues and Challenges 
Following were the issues we faced:

1)The major issue arose was to search and find out the various available datasets on the crop and agricultural department of India.

2) The risk lies in the authenticity and availability of the dataset and thus we tried to make numerous calls and verifications for the same.

3) We also tried to establish a communication with the IMD Associate Director-General for the same.

4) Also, the selection of the algorithm was a major difficulty to understand which one should be selected depending on various factors such as the accuracy, efficiency and authenticity

5) The accuracy of the speech to text conversion software was not up-to the mark 
Section Nine: Collaboration and Support

The areas of working on topics related to machine learning and data processing would be a topic of discussion with other groups.



# Steps to run the code
