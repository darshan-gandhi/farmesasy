# Problem Definition

In order to mitigate the agrarian crisis in the current status quo, there is a need for better recommendation systems to alleviate the crisis by helping the farmers to make an informed decision before starting the cultivation of crops. The “Crop Advisor for Crop Cultivation using Machine Learning” will be an application that will suggest suitable crops to be cultivated based on various factors such as rainfall, temperature, soil type etc. 

Scope – To recommend optimum crops to be cultivated by farmers based on various parameters and help them make an informed decision before cultivation   
The application would entail the following modules with the following functionalities:

1.) Web interface: The Web Interface will interact with the farmers to collect information and statistics

It will interact with the Cloud Storage to store in Database.

Will transfer the data to the Machine Learning agent for subsequent processing of data.

2.) Machine Learning Agent:

Training of data

Testing on a section of test data

Prediction based on the trained dataset

3.) Cloud Database: Storing of information and subsequent transfer of information to Machine Learning agent

Updation of Data

# Steps to run the code 

1 ) Install Flask 

2 ) Set up the environment

3 ) Clone this repository and download it to your local computer

4 ) Navigate to where the folder is downloaded 

5 ) Go to the folder Crop-Advisory-System-master

5 ) Run the app.py file using the command python app.py in your terminal 

6 ) Input the values on the rendered html page

7 ) Check the results obtained 


# Conclusion 

Thus, here we have successfully built a web application which helps to suggest farmers crops they should intent to grow by taking in various parameters.
